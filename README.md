## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- While developing, I integrated the logo into the title bar.

- Built a dropdown menu for selecting conversion categories, which caused some alignment bugs that I‚Äôm still improving.

- Added input/output text boxes for conversion.

- Encountered common Tkinter issues such as widget stretching, text alignment, and callback errors when wiring up the Convert button.
